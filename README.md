## Short explaination of the game:

You have to explore the world. As you find new stuff in the world, like new animals, plants or buildings you create a note. You can edit this note like in a text editor. If you want to research stuff, you write a note with all information about the thing you want to research in a note. Than you research with the note and with a little bit of luck you are succesfull.
